    <summary>nanoCAD is professional software with familiar interface, powerful drafting and 
             design tools, native DWG compatibility, and open API.</summary>
    <description>## nanoCAD is a multi-purpose free drafting software
    nanoCAD is an easy-to-use CAD application that delivers a great user experience by providing 
    high performance, full capability, a classic interface and native .dwg format support. 
    nanoCAD has been built to deliver design and project documentation for all industries. 
    nanoCAD includes a full suite of basic and advanced tools, for creating industry-standard 
    DWG-compatible CAD files. nanoCAD provides innovative, collaborative and customizable 
    features to enhance your efficiency. nanoCAD includes several API's, allowing anything 
    from routine task automation to complex CAD application development. All for free.

    ## Industry-standard user interface
    nanoCAD implements a very efficient, and easy to learn, classic-style CAD user interface. 
    It offers a command set and UI elements appearance that will be familiar and comfortable 
    to users of many other compatible CAD applications. The drawing space, command line, and 
    position of the menu items and icons on the toolbars are readily recognizable. Any person 
    with AutoCAD experience will feel at home using nanoCAD, right from the start.

    ## Clean and native *.dwg support
    nanoCAD uses the industry-standard DWG &#40;*.dwg&#41; file format natively. Drawings created 
    or edited in nanoCAD can be used by almost any other popular CAD system, without conversion 
    or data loss. If you can&#39;t open a drawing from another system due to damage, or you want 
    to audit an opened drawing for errors, or you need to reduce file size, nanoCAD provides 
    Audit, Recover and Purge commands. Be assured you will not lose document data due to software 
    or hardware failures thanks to nanoCAD&#39;s autosaving and backup functions.          

    ## Comprehensive command set
    nanoCAD includes an extensive set of tools for creating and editing 2D/3D objects. There are 
    often multiple drawing methods available for creating most geometric elements. It's 
    well-thought-out object editing commands allow you to modify drawings with minimal mouse 
    clicks. Reusable blocks and references to external drawings simplify and speed up the drawing 
    process. Advanced dimensioning features enable you to create any kind of dimensions by several
    means.       

    ## Powerful Table Editor
    nanoCAD has a powerful Excel-style table editor, with an extensive set of capabilities, 
    including the ability to create tables containing cells with embedded macros and formulas.  

    ## ActiveX Automation and LISP
    The nanoCAD scripting engine allows average users to automate everyday routine tasks. Users 
    can write macros using Visual Basic Script, Java Script or any other scripting language 
    supported by Microsoft Windows as well as built-in LISP.       

    ## C++/C# API
    nanoCAD has several types of APIs for building CAD applications on top of its core 
    functionality. NRX is a C++ and .NET API very similar to AutoCAD's ARX. It allows the 
    translation of AutoCAD-based applications to nanoCAD with ease. It is an object-oriented, 
    compact and robust programming interface. It is field proven, and has been used to create 
    a large number of commercial CAD applications.

    nanoCAD also features the MultiCAD API™ for C++ and .NET, a revolutionary development tool 
    to create binary compatible applications for different CAD platforms. Applications developed 
    with the MultiCAD API will be able to run not just in nanoCAD, but also in other compatible 
    CAD systems—including AutoCAD.      

    ## Extended plotting	
    nanoCAD's plot settings dialog allow you to set multiple plot areas, and create multi-page 
    plots. This can be especially useful for printing large drawings on printers with smaller 
    output format. The Batch Plot command creates and prints drawing sets without requiring you 
    to babysit the process. It is convenient when you need to print existing projects. It also 
    supports outputting drawings to single or multi-sheet plot files.
